# Wanderer

Short guide:

Every time in a location you will see in top you health points (**HP**) and what's inside your backpack (**BKPCK**)

Then, there will be displayed list of actions (in square brackets, **bold**) and objects (after semicolon), with which you can perform an action
First of all you should enter type of action. Then, if required, you would have to specify details (\*)

Every time you are asked to enter something (after \>) you can see possible options above. Type exactly the same option.

Commands (fight, talk, take, go) are case insensitive
Locations are case sensitive

\*If there is a single personage to talk to, to fight with or a single item to take, it won't ask specification
Otherwise, after typing action, you should specify on whom/what perform an action
