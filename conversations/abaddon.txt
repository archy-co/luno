Hello, I was waiting for u.
Who are you?
You already know
Abaddon?
Bingo. You know, you can't defeat me. Join me, and we will destroy this planet together.
Wait what? No, I don't wanna destroy this planet.
Why? Isn't it joyful
Not for me, I have a lot of friends here.
But you are not from this planet, why are you trying to trick yourself?
I know I'm not. But I belong here.
No, there is no point to live among human, miserable and stupid creatures who destroy everything they touch: nature, ecosystem, ozone layer...
They are kind! They are trying their best. Leave me alone. I won't team up with u
There's no other way then to fight. You will never defeat me
